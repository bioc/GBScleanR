Description: GBScleanR is a package for quality check, filtering, and error correction
   of genotype data derived from next generation sequcener (NGS) based genotyping platforms.
   GBScleanR takes Variant Call Format (VCF) file as input. The main function of this package 
   is `estGeno()` which estimates the true genotypes of samples from given read counts for
   genotype markers using a hidden Markov model with incorporating uneven observation ratio of 
   allelic reads. This implementation gives robust genotype estimation even in noisy genotype
   data usually observed in Genotyping-By-Sequnencing (GBS) and similar methods, e.g. RADseq.
   GBScleanR currenly only supports genotype data of biparental populations.
