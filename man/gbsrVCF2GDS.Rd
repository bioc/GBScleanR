\title{Convert a VCF file to a GDS file}
\usage{
gbsrVCF2GDS(vcf_fn, out_fn, force = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{vcf_fn}{A string to indicate path to an input VCF file.}

\item{out_fn}{A string to indicate path to an output GDS file.}

\item{force}{A logical value to overwrite a GDS file even if
the file specified in "out_fn" exists.}
}
\value{
The output GDS file path.
}
\description{
This function converts a variant call data in the VCF format.
The current implementation only accepts biallelic
single nucleotide polymorphisms.
Please filter out variants which are insertions and
deletions or multiallelic.
You may use "bcftools" or "vcftools" for filtering.
}
\details{
gbsrVCF2GDS converts a VCF file to a GDS file.
The data structure of the GDS file created via this functions is same with
those created by \code{snpgdsVCF2GDS} of
\href{https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SNPRelate.html}{SNPRelate}.
Unlike the GDS files created by \code{SNPRelate} \code{GBScleanR}'s GDS files: \cr
\itemize{
\item{"Include annotation information of variants
recorded in the \code{INFO} filed of the input VCF."}
\item{"Include allelic read count data (indicated as AD)
recoreded in the \code{FORMAT} filed of the input VCF."}
}
}
\examples{
# Create a GDS file from a sample VCF file.
vcf_fn <- system.file("extdata", "sample.vcf", package = "GBScleanR")
gds_fn <- tempfile("sample", fileext = ".gds")
gbsrVCF2GDS(vcf_fn = vcf_fn, out_fn = gds_fn, force = TRUE)

# Load data in the GDS file and instantiate a `GbsrGenotypeData` object.
gdata <- loadGDS(gds_fn)

# Close the connection to the GDS file.
closeGDS(gdata)
